Carole, I found the solution to the error I was getting upon pushing... maybe!

Briefly, I had to
1) "fork" your repository to my profile
2) clone your repository from my profile

What I had, instead, done was to directly clone your repository
from your profile, without forking :)
Let's see though...
Keep you posted.

YEAHHHHHH! It was exactly this one the error!
See ya!
